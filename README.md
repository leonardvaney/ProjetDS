ProjetDS
========

ProjetDS is a game made as an academical project for the course "Systèmes embarqués microprogrammés" (EE-310) at the EPFL in the winter semester of 2020.

How to play it
--------------

Press A to start the game.
There are in total two mini-game that cycle randomly:
In one of them you have to move a ballon with the directional keys to reach the goal at the upper right of the screen.
In the other one, you have to cut the targets (not just click on it) to make them all turn blue.

In case of a defeat (no more heart), press A to begin a new game.
